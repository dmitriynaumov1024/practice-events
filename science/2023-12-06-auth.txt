Simplified auth logic for development purposes only:
- using request header Authorization: personId={personId}
- logged-in user always sends url encoded session info in Authorization header

Real auth logic:
- using request header Authorization: sessionId={sessionId}&password={password}
- sessionId: Integer
- password: String, up to 512 characters
- user session is created on /auth/login, return session info
- user session is refreshed on /auth/refresh, return session info
- user session is terminated on /auth/logout
- logged-in user always sends url encoded session info in Authorization header
- sometimes server returns json-encoded session info in response body
